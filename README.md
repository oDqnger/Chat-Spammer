# Chat Spammer

# DISCLAIMER
You are 100% responsible for the way you use this program. This program does not have any limit so you could technically break your, or other people's devices by using this to the maximum. This is for educational purposes only.


# What is this about?
This is a program that spams/repeats a certain message through any chat application. This program allows you to set a custom message to send, it allows you to set the delay after each message has been sent (anything below 0.5s might break your pc), it allows you to set a timer for how long you want the spammer to be running and the amount of times you want the program to be sending the message.

# How to run the program?
To run this, make sure you have python 3+ installed in your PC and make sure you have the 'keyboard' library installed by doing this in your cmd:
```
pip install keyboard
```

Then download the main.py file, navigate to the main.py file in your cmd and run the file.

```
python main.py
```

# NOTE:
This software does not have any limit, so you can break your PC or get in trouble by doing this. When the program asks you to input the delay after each message has been sent, I highly recommend that you enter a delay above 0.2.
If there are any problems with the code, you may open an issue for this repo. Or if you know how to fix it, you may as well open a pull request.
